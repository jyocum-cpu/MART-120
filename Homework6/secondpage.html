            <title>My Story and a Little About Me</title>
            <body>Hello! My name is Jadynn Yocum and I am from the Midwest; Wisconsin to be exact. I grew up on a farm and lived in the beautiful Driftless Region. I love nature and being in the outdoors, so when I turned 21, I moved to where you can get the most public land. Montana; specifically the Missoula area. I love videography and photography and I'm excited to use this website to showcase my photos.
